# House Price Prediction
Problem Statement:
The problem at hand is to develop a reliable and accurate predictive model for estimating housing prices in the city of Boston. Currently, potential buyers, sellers, and real estate agents face significant challenges in determining the fair market value of residential properties due to the complex interplay of various factors that influence housing prices. These factors include location, size, number of rooms, crime rate, accessibility to amenities, and other socio-economic indicators.
     Such a solution would greatly benefit potential buyers, sellers, real estate professionals, and policymakers by enabling them to make informed decisions, optimize property transactions, and enhance overall market efficiency in the city of Boston.
